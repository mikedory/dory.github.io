## What do you do?

All sorts of stuff!  I co-founded [Socialbomb](http://socialbomb.com), a social technology agency based in Brooklyn. I've taught at places like [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu) and [General Assembly](http://generalassemb.ly/), and spoken at places like [O'Reilly OSCon](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011) and the [Mobile Gaming Summit](http://nyc.mogasummit.com/). 

Most recently, I co-wrote a book for [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com/) called [Introduction to Tornado](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021292.do), which is out now!

## Hey, I want to get in touch with you!

That sounds rad! You can:

- read my witty banter on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mike_dory)
- check out my timeline on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/michael.dory)
- fork my latest work on [Github](https://github.com/mikedory)
- do... professional stuff... on [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldory)

But for most things, you can also just [email](mailto:mike@dory.me) me. It would be cool to hear from you!

## So, how did you make this thing?

This site was built using [Hyde](https://hyde.github.com/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), with a few Python tools thrown in for good measure. [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) handle styles and scripting. It is served via Ruby/Rack on [Heroku](http://heroku.com), and the source is up on [Github](https://github.com).
