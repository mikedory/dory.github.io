So as you might have gathered by the pile of noise I'd made here and on the varying interwebs leading up to it, I had the pleasure of presenting at the Facebook Developers Garage NYC last night. &nbsp;  

<a href='http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/doryex/BvtlaonjjoygeqibfgCzzxCnlcghinksJCwAfkwrBbEaukrdqAgysuwJvgqk/media_httpfarm5static_wIojy.jpg.scaled1000.jpg'><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/doryex/BvtlaonjjoygeqibfgCzzxCnlcghinksJCwAfkwrBbEaukrdqAgysuwJvgqk/media_httpfarm5static_wIojy.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" height="374"/></a>   

It was a blast, with a good turnout and a great crowd, and I got to give a talk about our experiences here at Socialbomb with our involvement in getting True Blood Live Feed going and what we'd learned from the process.

The event was hosted by the nice folks at Syncapse, and featured a platform talk from Facebook's Matt Kelly as well as development tales from SocialAmp, Large Animal and Ready, Set, Rocket (as well as yours truly).&nbsp;Over 200 local developers, marketers and agency people gathered at Webster Hall to network and share information with members of the Facebook team.  

I always told myself I'd stand on the stage at Webster Hall one day, and I did it with a mic in my hand. &nbsp;I mean, to a room full of developers and nerds, but hey, a goal is a goal, right?
