Location: E143/144
Rate this session

    Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. Itâ€™s intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

    In this tutorial, participants will learn how to create devices for sensing and communicating with the physical world using the Arduino platform. This session will feature an introduction to physical computing and interfacing with microcontrollers, as well as the basics of Arduino (hardware and software) and using it with the Processing programming environment.

    The materials fee ($85) allows you to go home with an Arduino microcontroller board, a variety of components including LEDs, resistors, and sensors; and a copy of Making Things Talk.
