excerpt: OSCON is where all of the pieces come together: developers, innovators, businesspeople, and investors. In the early days, this trailblazing O’Reilly event was focused on changing mainstream business thinking and practices; today OSCON is about how the close partnership between business and the open source community is building the future. That future is everywhere you look.

    Tornado was written with performance in mind, aiming to solve the C10k problem, so by design it’s an extremely high-performance framework. It’s also packed with handy tools for dealing with social networks, user authentication, and all sorts of asynchronous fun.

    In this talk, we’ll cover the basics of the Tornado framework, starting with the features that make it so great, and working our way towards some real-life examples. We’ll cover the best practices for implementation and deployment, as well as a sampling of uses for the technology.
