## An Introduction to Developing with the Facebook API // TECH 478

### Michael Dory, Founder and CTO, Socialbomb  
_Tuesday, May 10th from 8:00 pm to 9:30 pm._

Facebook launched the Facebook Platform in 2007, giving developers access to an incredible amount of data about users, their friends, and their activities online. Over the past four years, the platform has matured and grown by leaps and bounds, adding in support for pages, places, photos, and more, while providing a powerful set of tools to developers.

However, diving into the API and the provided plugins and SDKs can be intimidating â€” there's a lot of acronyms and terms to decipher (REST, Graph, FBML, FBJS, FQL), and the documentation and examples found online can be confusing or at times simply out of date.

This class will give developers an overview of these tools, as well as outlining best practices for building applications on or through Facebook. We'll cover the primary Facebook API's, the use cases for each, and some examples of how to use user data to enrich your sites and projects.

_Participants in this session will need to be familiar with HTML, CSS and at least a little JavaScript, although anyone comfortable with REST APIs should be able to keep up just fine._
