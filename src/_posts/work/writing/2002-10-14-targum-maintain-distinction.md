excerpt: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is the official name of this institution. It is the name that appears on all University letterhead, printed on all campus signs and is the payee when students make out checks for tuition. If a comprehensive proposal unveiled yesterday by Gov. James E. McGreevey gets approved, the present University everyone knows and usually loves may become only a memory.
