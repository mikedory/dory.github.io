It is with equal parts pride and excitement that we at Socialbomb announce here the launch of Fisher-Price Moments to Share, the app we've been hard at work on over the past months.

Moments to Share is a Facebook application that lets users record their children's special moments in a dynamic timeline of digital photos, videos, captions and stories, and then share them with friends and family. 

We're thrilled to see this go out into the wild, and we're looking forward to seeing to seeing how people use it.
