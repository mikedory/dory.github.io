excerpt: I'll be presenting Socialbomb with Adam and Scott at the ETech ArtsFair, running a full game on the show floor and babbling endlessly about delocalized gaming and proximity-focused sensors, and... oh, sorry, I tend to rant.

We <a href="http://www.socialbomb.net">Socialbomb</a> folks (Adam, Scott and I) have been quite busy lately, making prototypes, writing proposals and presenting things at various places.  So far, the latter point has mostly involved the <a href="http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/berkley/bpc.cfm?doc_id=6306">Stern Business Plan Competition</a>, which we are Semi-Finalists in (and still in the final running), but it's about to lead us to San Diego for O'Reilly ETech, and we are more stoked than ever.

I'll be presenting Socialbomb with Adam and Scott at the ETech ArtsFair, running a full game on the show floor and babbling endlessly about delocalized gaming and proximity-focused sensors, and... oh, sorry, I tend to rant.  In short, it should be a blast.  Going to be at ETech?  Come <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2010">find us</a> and play a game!

See you there!
