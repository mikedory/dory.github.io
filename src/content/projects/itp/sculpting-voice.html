Following on the heels of a few other performances recently, I had the great pleasure of joining several of my favorite folks at Monkey Town this past Friday to make some noise as part of the Sculpting Voice show, curated by Lesley Flanigan (who I also performed with, see below).

From the flyer:

<blockquote>Sculpting Voice is a night of performances exploring how voice can be shaped, destroyed, orchestrated and processed to build space.

A voice is as unique as a fingerprint and speaks in both presence and absence. In an evening of performances ranging from the sublime to the
insane, performers will use human voice to shape audio, video, theater, dance and origami. Performers will include R. Luke DuBois,
Lesley Flanigan, Andrew Schneider, Joo Youn Paek, Adam Parrish, Nick Hasty, Nancy Garcia, Eric Beug, Christopher McDonald, Mike Dory, and Dafna Naphtali</blockquote>

Lesley and I chose to make our performance a conversation between two distinct voices: her Speaker Synth project and my bass guitar.  She warmed the synth up, exhibited a range of tones, and then set up a repeating loop.  I did the same, first exploring the range of the bass and then settling into a groove.  The performance mutated a bit as we went back and forth, finally closing with us both fading the loops out.  It came out even better than I'd have hoped, and I'm looking forward to doing so again.

It was a beautiful evening of sounds quiet and loud, calm and energetic, usual and decidedly un.  Lesley has said she'll be doing other shows like this, which I look forward to!  In the meantime, Lesley and I have agreed to do the same type of set at BENT festival, so watch for us there as well.
