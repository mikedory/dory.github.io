## A Business Perspective on the Facebook Platform // BUSINESS 457

### Michael Dory, Founder and CTO, Socialbomb  
_Tuesday, April 26th from 8:00 pm to 9:30 pm._

It would be difficult to overstate the influence of Facebook now, as a worldwide phenomenon with over 600 million users and counting. Creatives and developers alike have learned just how much they can accomplish by tapping into a network of that size, but have also learned some tough lessons along the way. Here in 2011, what are the best approaches for launching and maintaining successful Facebook campaigns?

Facebook offers many tools to developers and brands seeking to run campaigns on their platform. Facebook pages, canvas applications, and Connect-enabled sites have enabled companies to use the power of the Facebook graph in a wide variety of situations. However, it can be difficult to get a grasp on what's best to do, how it's best done, and what users expect to see.

This course will address those concerns, with an overview of the offerings, examples of past campaigns that have succeeded (alongside some that have failed), and suggestions for how you might best use the Facebook platform for your next project. We'll also cover some best practices for how to keep your users happy, and use the environment to truly connect with fans and newcomers alike.
