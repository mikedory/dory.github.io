=======

This site is hosted on Heroku, running on Rack/Thin, generated by Jekyll, and ably assisted by SCSS, Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5Boilerplate, and Coffeescript.

This repo has the source, with tasks handled by the Rakefile.

Someday I might clean this up. I also might not!

Installation
------------

__To set up jekyll:__

	bundle install

That's it! =)


Developing
----------

Most tasks are easiest handled by rake.  For example, to do local development, run:

	rake local:dev

And to mimic what will be served on Heroku, you can run:

	rake heroku:serve


## requirements: ##

So this is being fixed up, but right now this setup requires more than a few things. Most notably, you will need:

- jekyll
- rake
- rack

All of these things are easily handled by Bundler (via the Gemfile), so this should never be a worry.
