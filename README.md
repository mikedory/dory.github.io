=======

This site is hosted on Heroku, running on Rack/Thin, generated by Jekyll, and ably assisted by SCSS, Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5Boilerplate, and Coffeescript.

This is the in-development port of my previous (also in progress) site from Hyde to Jeykll.  As such, things might be kind of... interesting.

This repo has the source, with tasks handled by the Rakefile.  Someday I might clean this up. I also might not!

Installation
------------

__To set up jekyll:__

	bundle install

There's likely other stuff to worry about. I will add that here eventually.

Developing
----------

Most tasks are easiest handled by rake.  For example, to do local development, run:

	rake local:dev

That will set up processes to watch the coffeescript and scss files, fire up Jekyll on auto mode, and serve the whole thing via Rack on port 5000.

To mimic what will be served on Heroku, you can run:

	rake heroku:serve


## requirements: ##

So this is being fixed up, but right now this setup requires more than a few things. Most notably, you will need:

- jekyll
- rake
- rack

All of these things are easily handled by Bundler (via the Gemfile), so this should never be a worry.
