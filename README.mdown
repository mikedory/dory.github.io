# Dory.me

This site is hosted on Heroku, running on Rack, generated by Hyde, and ably assisted by SCSS, Bootstrap, HTML5Boilerplate, and Coffeescript.

This repo has the source and output both, along with some helper things (a Fabfile, etc.). Someday I might clean this up. I also might not!

---

## usage: ##

__To set up hyde:__

	hyde gen
	hyde serve


__To rock the SASS/SCSS action:__

(from the repo's main directory)

	sass --watch content/static/css/style.scss:content/static/css/style.css
	
	
__To do it the easy way:__

To just regen the files and fire the dev server back up, run:

	fab reserve

To do a fresh generation of files (remove the deploy directory, etc.), run:

	fab reserve:fresh

## requirements: ##

So this is being fixed up, but right now this setup requires more than a few things. Most notably, you will need:

- hyde

		pip install hyde

- ruby
	- with the sass gem

			gem install sass

- fabric
	
		pip install fabric
